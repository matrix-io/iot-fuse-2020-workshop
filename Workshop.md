# Overview

This workshop will go over how you can easily employ a privacy-focused voice assistant with MATRIX devices, an IoT development platform powered by Arm microcontrollers and Xilinx FPGAs, on the Mozilla IoT WebThings Gateway to quickly deploy an effective voice-enabled product for your home or company.

The workshop will walk through how to use the Mozilla IoT Gateway through its UI as well as with voice commands to read MATRIX device sensors, control LEDs, GPIOs, and more. Participants can then create custom rules with these tools to set up their assistant to suit their needs, from personal home automation, to warehouse item provisioning, or retail voice assistance.

We will show you how to:
- Set the LEDs manually from the GUI
- Enable the voice assistant (one you can use from a website)
- Trigger LEDs from voice assistant
- Add rule based on UV value to trigger notification & LED color change
